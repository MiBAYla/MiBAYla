- 👋 Hello! My name is Mikayla Serrell. I'm a college freshman in Northern Virginia pursuing chemical and environmental engineering for climate protection. 🌎👍
- 👀 The most environmentally helpful action we can take is informing others about the problem. Only 61% of American adults know climate change is occurring and that it is human-caused, but our country is a large part of the problem, so we must learn to be a large part of the solution.  
- 🌱 I’m excited to announce that the application for the 2023 Natural Capital Chesapeake Bay Project is open! You can submit it through the Google form linked below. 
- 📫 If you have any questions about the project details, the schedule will be posted shortly, and don't hesitate to contact naturefundraiser@gmail.com
